## About
UVeh-Vis is a utility designed for plotting UV-Vis spectra from QChem output files (and additional features coming soon). This tool operates by entry the relevant file(s), specifying the initial and final wavelength, and providing the standard deviation.

## Getting the source code

Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/joaquinbarroso/UVeh-Vis.git
```

This will featch the entire repository called *UVeh-Vis*.
